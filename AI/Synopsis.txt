The project titled “PvP 2D Tactical Shooter Game” is designed and developed as an online competitive multiplayer game focused on fast-paced Team Deathmatch (TDM) gameplay. The primary objective of this project is to create a functional browser-based game where players can engage in real-time combat in a team-versus-team environment. The gameplay emphasizes strategy, coordination, and reflexes, allowing players to compete in short, action-packed rounds.

The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing popularity of online multiplayer games and the educational opportunity to explore game development, real-time networking, and interactive web applications. This project serves as both a technical and creative endeavor, demonstrating the practical implementation of game mechanics, multiplayer synchronization, and persistent player data handling.

The game is developed using a MERN-based technology stack along with Kaplay.js (formerly Kaboom.js) for rendering 2D game elements and Colyseus for real-time multiplayer functionality. The backend, built with Node.js and ExpressJS, manages player connections, matchmaking, game state, and database operations. MongoDB is used to store persistent data such as player statistics, match history, and leaderboard information. The frontend, implemented with React, provides a responsive and interactive interface for player login, lobby navigation, and in-game interactions.

In this TDM setup, two teams of players compete to achieve the highest number of eliminations within a fixed time limit or until a score threshold is reached. Players respawn after elimination, and the game continues until the round ends, at which point the team with the higher score is declared the winner. The game also tracks player statistics such as total kills, matches played, and top scores, which are displayed in leaderboards to encourage competition and engagement.

From a technical perspective, the project focuses on real-time state management, collision detection, and network synchronization to provide smooth multiplayer gameplay. Colyseus ensures low-latency communication between clients, while Kaplay.js efficiently renders dynamic 2D game elements. The game also implements error handling and session management to maintain stability even when players disconnect or rejoin mid-match.

The key challenges addressed in this project include maintaining a consistent game state across multiple clients, handling concurrent player actions, and ensuring fair and synchronized gameplay for all participants. By tackling these challenges, the project demonstrates practical knowledge in multiplayer game design, network programming, and web-based application development.

The expected outcome of this project is a fully functional, browser-based TDM game capable of supporting multiple concurrent players. It showcases an engaging multiplayer experience, effective use of modern web and game development frameworks, and a comprehensive understanding of client-server architecture, real-time communication, and interactive frontend design.

In conclusion, the PvP 2D Tactical Shooter Game represents a successful integration of game mechanics, web technologies, and real-time multiplayer systems. It highlights both technical skills and creative problem-solving, providing an entertaining platform for competitive gameplay while demonstrating a strong grasp of modern software development principles.
