Step 1, Create a New Particle System: In the Unity Editor, select the Game Object where you want to add the snowfall effect.

Step 2, Configure the Particle System: In the Inspector window, you'll see the Particle System component's settings. Adjust these settings to create a snowfall effect: 
- Duration: Set this to a value that suits the length of your snowfall scene. For an ongoing snowfall, you can set it to a high value or loop the system. 
-	Start Lifetime: This determines how long each snowflake particle will stay on screen. Set it to a value that makes the snowflakes fall for an appropriate amount of time (e.g., 5 seconds). 
-	Start Speed: Adjust the initial speed of the snowflakes. Typically, a small value like 1-5 units per second will work. 
-	Start Size: Set the size of the snowflakes. They should be small, like 0.05 to 0.2. 
-	Start Color: Choose a light blue or white color to resemble snow. 
-	Emission: Configure the rate at which particles are emitted. Set the rate to create a dense snowfall. For example, you might try starting with 100 particles per second. 
-	Shape: Choose "Cone" as the shape and adjust the angle and radius to control the area where snowflakes will spawn. 
-	Gravity Modifier: Apply a downward force (negative value) to simulate gravity. Use a small negative value, like -0.1, to make snowflakes fall gently 

Step 3: Press the Play button in Unity to see your snowfall effect in action.
